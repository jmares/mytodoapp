# MyTodoApp

A todo app made with python, flask and bootstrap.

## Goal

## App

- I use Visual Studio Code.
- Created a virtual environment for Python (Python 3.11.2)
- I am using Windows 11. Haven't tested the code on MacOS or Linux.
- You will need to install the follow Python modules: Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy

pip install flask
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```

## Version 0.1

**Date**: 08/10/2023

As it is my first time working with Flask, this version is completely based on the YouTube video [Building a Todo List App: Introduction to Flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mH_VpW1Bko) by Alina Chudnova.
