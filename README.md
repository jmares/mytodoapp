# MyTodoApp

A todo app made with Python, Flask and Bootstrap.

## Goal

## App

- I use Visual Studio Code.
- Created a virtual environment for Python (Python 3.11.2)
- I am using Windows 11. Haven't tested the code on MacOS or Linux.
- You will need to install the following Python modules: Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy

```shell
pip install flask
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```
